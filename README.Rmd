# covid19usa

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the `covid19usa` package is to provide an embedded interactive R Shiny web application for key data visualisation of Covid-19 cases and testing efficiency across the U.S states. This package is built by refactoring the user-interface and server-side logic of a previously developed shiny web application for 'ETC5523: Shiny Assessment'.
