<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the `covid19usa` package is to provide an embedded
interactive R Shiny web application for key data visualisation of
Covid-19 cases and testing efficiency across the U.S states. This
package is built by refactoring the user-interface and server-side logic
of a previously developed shiny web application for ‘ETC5523: Shiny
Assessment’.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-BrendiA)
